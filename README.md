# Decentralized Medical Equipment Sharing Network

A blockchain-based platform enabling healthcare facilities to share specialized medical equipment, optimize resource utilization, and reduce costs while maintaining accountability and quality.

## Overview

The Decentralized Medical Equipment Sharing Network creates an ecosystem where healthcare providers can securely register, verify, reserve, and maintain specialized medical equipment across facilities. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures transparency, trust, and efficient allocation of expensive medical resources, ultimately improving patient care while reducing capital expenditures.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Device Registration Contract

Records and verifies details of specialized medical equipment available for sharing.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive equipment specifications and capabilities
- Ownership and location tracking
- Operational status monitoring
- Usage history and maintenance records
- Compliance and certification documentation
- Equipment valuation and depreciation tracking
- Image and technical documentation storage

### Facility Verification Contract

Validates and manages the credentials of legitimate healthcare providers within the network.

**Key Features:**
- Healthcare facility licensing verification
- Staff credentials and authorization levels
- Insurance and liability coverage confirmation
- Geographic service area definition
- Facility ratings and feedback system
- Regulatory compliance tracking
- Dispute resolution protocol participation

### Reservation Management Contract

Handles the scheduling, usage tracking, and access control for shared equipment.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time availability calendar
- Priority-based reservation system
- Usage duration tracking and enforcement
- Equipment transfer documentation
- Transportation logistics coordination
- Emergency override capabilities
- Cancellation and modification policies
- Usage reporting and analytics

### Maintenance Fund Contract

Manages the shared costs for equipment maintenance, repairs, and quality assurance.

**Key Features:**
- Usage-based contribution calculations
- Maintenance schedule enforcement
- Repair request and approval workflow
- Fund allocation transparency
- Service provider management
- Cost sharing among participating facilities
- Preventative maintenance incentives
- Fund balance and transaction history

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Polygon for smart contract deployment
- **Storage**: IPFS for equipment documentation and certification storage
- **Oracle Integration**: Chainlink for external data verification (licenses, certifications)
- **Frontend**: React-based responsive web application and mobile interface
- **IoT Integration**: Equipment status monitoring and usage verification
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for equipment access

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Truffle or Hardhat for smart contract development
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Healthcare facility credentials and documentation
- Equipment technical specifications

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-equipment-sharing.git
cd medical-equipment-sharing

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

### Configuration

1. Register your healthcare facility in the verification contract
2. Submit required documentation for facility validation
3. Register equipment available for sharing
4. Configure contribution parameters for the maintenance fund
5. Set up notification preferences for reservation alerts

## Use Cases
